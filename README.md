The project focuses on developing a mobile application tailored for the streamlined delivery of agricultural tools  and supplies to farmers, aiming to overcome the accessibility challenges faced by the agricultural community.Buyers can effortlessly register, select products, view fixed prices, and receive  their deliveries. On the seller side, the application provides a platform for registration, enabling  sellers to list products with detailed information and efficiently manage their inventory. The backend  infrastructure will leverage technologies such as Python and MySQL, while the frontend will be crafted  using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
